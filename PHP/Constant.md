Constants are similar to variables, holding information to be accessed later, except that they are what they sound like—constant. In other words, once you have defined one, its value is set for the remainder of the program and cannot be altered

```php
define("ROOT_LOCATION", "/usr/local/www/"); 
$directory = ROOT_LOCATION; //to read the root_location
```

# Predefined Constant
PHP comes ready-made with dozens of predefined constants that you won’t generally use as a beginner. However, there are a few—known as the magic constants—that you will find useful.
