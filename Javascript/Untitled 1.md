Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the `let` keyword.
```js
let hello = "Hello";
```

In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using `console.log()`. For example, this code will print `"Naomi"` to the console:

Example Code:

```js
let developer = "Naomi";
console.log(developer);
```

The code above accesses the `developer` variable with its name in the `console.log()`. Note that the value between the parentheses is the value that will be printed.

Print the value of the `character` variable to the console. Then, click the "Console" button to view the JavaScript console.

When you declare a variable without initializing it, it is considered uninitialized. The default value of an uninitialized variable is `undefined`.

Arrays are denoted using square brackets (`[]`). Here is an example of a variable with the value of an empty array:
Example Code
```js
let array = [];
console.log(array); //print array
console.log(array[1]);
```
`array.length` returns the number of elements in the array.
`push()` allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array. Here is an example to add the number `12` to the end of an array. It returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.
`pop()` removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

`for(iterator; condition; iteration){}`
```js
for (const value of iterable) {

}
```

`.repeat()`his method accepts a number as an argument, specifying the number of times to repeat the target string. For example, using `.repeat()` to generate the string `"Code! Code! Code!"`:
Example Code
```js
const activity = "Code! ";
activity.repeat(3);
```
