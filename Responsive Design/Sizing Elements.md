## Em
- represents the font-size of the current element or the default base font-size set by the browser if none is given. 
- For example, if the base font of a browser is 16 pixels (which is normally the default size of text in a browser), then 1 em is equal to 16 pixels. 2 ems would equal 32 pixels, and so on.
## Rem
- Rem stands for _root em_. It acts similar to em, but instead of checking parent elements to size font, it checks the _root element_. The root element is the `<html>` tag.
